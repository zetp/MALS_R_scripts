# MALS R scripts
R scripts for analysis of SEC-MALS experiments. These are in-house scripts for automation of the last step of SEC-MALS experiments pipeline.

First script will make plot of overlaid UV280 signals from multiple experiments, with additional plot showing normalised data.

Second script will provide 280 UV signal for chosen experiment where information about nucleic acid content (UV254 to UV280 ratio) is displayed as colour of the line.
